# Wreckage-Navel-Combat

    This program is a windows form app version of Battleship I named Wreckage-Navel Combat.  It is written in C# with Visual Studio Community. To play the game compile the code and run the program. It will load up a windows form and you are ready to play. The grid on the top is the computers play grid and the bottom grid is yours. First you choose the locations for your five ships on the bottom grid. Then you choose locations on the top grid to attack. If you miss the spot turns grey, if you hit the spot turns red. As soon as you choose a spot to attack, the AI will choose a location to attack. The first one to take out all the ships of their opponent wins the match. Press the play again button to play another round or the quit button to exit the program.
